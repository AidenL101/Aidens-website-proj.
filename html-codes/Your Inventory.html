          <h1>Your Inventory!</h1>
          <p>In your inventory, you always want to make sure that you can access certain guns easily.
         </p>
         <p>
            I will talk more specificly for both Controller and keyboard & Mouse players.
         </p>
         <p>
            In your inventory, you have 5 available "slots" of weapon, health, and sheild items.
         </p>
         <p>
            Most health / shield granting items, have a limit of how many of that specific item in a single slot.
         </p>
         <p>
            All weapons take up a whole slot, and playing on controller, you can only go back and forth between slots,
         </p>
         <p>
            so you have to organize your inventory to where you can access your shotgun, AR, and SMG.

         <p>in a fortnite match, there are three main guns that you should use.</p>
         <p>You dont have to use all of them, but there are guns that you always want at all times.</p>
         <p>1. The AR, more formaly known as the assult rifle.</p>
         <p>2. The Shoutgun.</p>
         <p>3. The SMG, also known as the small machine gun</p>
         <p>4. What i call the Z weapon.</p>
      </div>  

      <img src="../Images/Z-key-img.png" style="max-width:120px;max-height: 120px;"
      alt="The Z key">

      <p>I call these guns, a Z weapon, is becuase when i use them on mouse and keyboard, i press Z to access them. </p>
      <p>These guns consist of snipers, RPG's and throwable items.</p>
      <p>Now that you know what your loadout (invintory) should like like,</p>
      <p>lets dive into how you can sort it.</p>
    
      <h2>Sorting your invintory. (For Controller players)</h2>
      <p>When your sorting your loudout, you want to make every gun accessable.</p>
      <p>For example, the way I sort my loudout, is i have my shotgun in the first slot.</p>
      <p>my SMG in the second, so with the press of one button i have my SMG out.</p>
      <p>in my middle slot, I have my health / shield items.</p>
      <p>in my second to lasat slot, i hold my Z weapon</p>
      <p>Then finally in my last slot, i hold my AR</p>
      <p>this way </p>
