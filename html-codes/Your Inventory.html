          <h1>Your Inventory!</h1>
          <p>In your inventory, you always want to make sure that you can access certain guns easily.
           
         </p>
         <p>
            I will talk more specificly for Controller and keyboard & Mouse players.
         </p>
         <p>
            In your inventory, you have 5 available "slots" of wepons, health, and sheild items.
         </p>
         <p>
            Most health / shield granting items, have a limit of how many of that specific item in a single slot.
         </p>
         <p>
            All weapons take up a whole slot, and playing on controller, you can only go back and forth between you slots,
         </p>
         <p>
            so you have to organize your inventory to where you can access your shotgun, AR, and SMG.
